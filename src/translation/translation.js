					"1. Managing the machines - keeping them ready, keep track of their health, scheduling maintenance, taking preventive actions, retiring them, etc.\n" +
					"2. Managing their use: Scheduling them for use, monitoring/tracking them, geo-fencing them, making sure they avoid obstacles, managing their range, accommodate environmental conditions, making them energy efficient/carbon-neutral, etc.\n" + 
					"3. Manage their security and privacy: When machines interact with humans or other machines, how do we ensure all the concerned parties are verified and trusted? How do we make sure a drone is not delivering a product to a wrong person? How do we ensure the robot is not keeping the package in the wrong shelf? How do we ensure a smart washing machine is not choosing the wrong wash cycle for heavy loads?"
